I am a Doctoral Researcher at the [RTG DYNAMICS](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics) graduate program at [Humboldt-UniversitÃ¤t zu Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en), jointly coordinated with the [Hertie School of Governance](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/). My research investigates how social networks mediate the relationship between institutions, civil society, life events, and political attitudes. Using comparative and longitudinal data, I explore how inequality and welfare regimes shape the structure and composition of individualsâ€™ personal networksâ€”and, in turn, how these networks influence interpersonal trust and broader political orientations.

Between March and April 2025, I was a visiting researcher at the [Swedish Institute for Social Research (SOFI)](https://www.su.se/swedish-institute-for-social-research/) at [Stockholm University](https://www.su.se/english/), specifically within the Social Policy Unit. During this stay, I deepened my understanding of comparative welfare state research and the use of large-scale administrative data for social science inquiry.

I hold a Master's and Bachelor's degree in Sociology from the [Pontifical Catholic University of Chile](https://www.uc.cl/) and the [University of Chile](https://www.uchile.cl/) respectively. Prior to my doctoral studies, I was Technical Coordinator of the Chilean Longitudinal Social Survey (ELSOC) at the Center for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies ([COES](https://coes.cl/)), where I specialized in survey design, panel data, and network analysis.

My academic work lies at the intersection of social stratification, social networks, and political behavior. I use quantitative and computational methodsâ€”including multilevel models, social network analysis, and experimentsâ€”to study social cohesion, distributive justice, and political attitudes in Latin America and beyond.
