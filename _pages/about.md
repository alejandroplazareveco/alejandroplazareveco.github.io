I am a Doctoral Researcher at the [RTG DYNAMICS](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics) graduate program at [Humboldt-UniversitÃ¤t zu Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en), jointly coordinated with the [Hertie School of Governance](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/). My research analyzes how social networks mediate the relationship between institutions, civil society, life events, and political attitudes. Using comparative and longitudinal data, I examine how inequality and welfare state regimes shape the structure and composition of individualsâ€™ personal networksâ€”and, in turn, how these network features influence interpersonal trust and broader political orientations.

I hold a Master's and Bachelor's degree in Sociology from the [Pontifical Catholic University of Chile](https://www.uc.cl/) and the [University of Chile](https://www.uchile.cl/) respectively. Prior to my doctoral studies, I was Technical Coordinator of the Chilean Longitudinal Social Survey (ELSOC) at the Center for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies (COES), where I specialized in survey design, panel data, and network analysis.

My academic work lies at the intersection of social stratification, social networks, and political behavior. I use quantitative and computational methodsâ€”including multilevel models, social network analysis, and experimentsâ€”to study social cohesion, distributive justice, and political attitudes in Latin America and beyond.
